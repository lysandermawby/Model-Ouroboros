# MNIST Model Collapse Experiment Configuration
# This file contains all hyperparameters and model architecture settings
# CLI arguments will override values specified here

# Experiment settings
experiment:
  iterations: 20                    # Number of dataset generation iterations 
  batch_size: 512                   # Batch size for training 
  num_generated_samples: 60000      # Samples generated per iteration (MNIST train set size)
  num_displayed_samples: 10         # Number of samples to visualize (must be a multiple of 10)

# VAE architecture and training
vae:
  layer_sizes: [784, 512, 256]      # Encoder/decoder hidden layers (first must be 784 for MNIST)
  latent_dim: 32                    # Latent space dimensionality
  learning_rate: 0.001              # VAE learning rate
  epochs: 10                        # Training epochs per iteration

# Classifier architecture and training
classifier:
  layer_sizes: [784, 512, 256, 128] # Hidden layers (first must be 784)
  num_classes: 10                   # Output classes (MNIST has 10 digits)
  learning_rate: 0.001              # Classifier learning rate
  epochs: 10                        # Training epochs per iteration

# Visualization settings
visualization:
  sample_gif_duration: 200          # Duration per frame in GIF (ms)
  training_curves_max_lines: 10     # Max curves to show in training plots
  colormap: 'viridis'               # Colormap for plots (matplotlib naming convention)

# Output settings
output:
  experiments_dir: '../experiments' # Directory for experiment outputs
